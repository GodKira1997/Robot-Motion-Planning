# Robot-Motion-Planning
This project aims to develop a robot motion planning system that implements advanced computational geometry algorithms to navigate point robots efficiently and safely through complex environments. 
Our approach will incorporate obstacle-avoiding
techniques such as Voronoi diagrams or visibility graphs (and might explore RRT) and in addition, pathplanning algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A*. We will also develop a visualization component that shows the
robot's planned path and the surrounding environment.
